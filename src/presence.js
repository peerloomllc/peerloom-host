// Presence: the host's registry of live media-channel push senders, keyed by device.
//
// The media API is otherwise pure request/response - the client asks, the host answers.
// One feature needs the host to speak first: cross-device session handoff. When device B
// claims the play-session token, the device that HELD it (A) must be told at once so it
// stops, instead of finding out lazily on its next heartbeat (proposal 2026-07-17,
// deferred follow-up #1). But B's claim runs on B's connection, and A is a DIFFERENT
// connection - so the host needs a way to reach A's channel from B's request. That is all
// this is: a shared map so any connection's handler can push to another device's channel.
//
// SECURITY. This adds NO access surface. A push only rides a channel that already exists,
// which only exists on a connection the firewall already admitted; register() is called
// from serveMedia AFTER the grant check. Revoke destroys the connection, whose channel
// close unregisters here, so a revoked device is gone from the registry and cannot be
// pushed to. The registry keys by the same z32 deviceKey string the grant carries.

const z32 = require('z32')
const { SCOPE } = require('./protocol/constants')

function keyOf (deviceKey) {
  return typeof deviceKey === 'string' ? deviceKey : z32.encode(deviceKey)
}

// Push to every device holding OWNER scope on this host - the operators, wherever they are signed
// in. The grant store is the authority on who that is (scope OWNER, not revoked); presence only
// reaches the ones with a live channel, and an owner who is offline picks the change up on their
// next load. Best-effort, like every push here.
//
// Factored out because there are now three callers and they must agree on who counts as an owner:
// a new request, a withdrawn one, and a resolved one. The first had this loop inline, and the
// other two had NOTHING - which is why an owner watching Manage saw a request arrive but never saw
// it leave (Tim, 2026-07-30).
