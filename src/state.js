// User state: the per-person state the HOST holds and serves.
//
// EXTRACTED FROM PEARTUNE, phase 3 of the approved shared-host split, and it is a
// MOVE rather than a rewrite. Every rule below was paid for by a bug in a shipped
// app; re-deriving them for a second app is how two divergent copies of the same
// store end up disagreeing about who watched what.
//
// The store is HOST-AS-HUB, not an Autobase ledger (PearTune proposal
// 2026-07-15-milestone-3-user-state, which SUPERSEDES the 2026-07-13 "host is a full
// Autobase writer" decision). A library host is always on, so it simply stores each
// person's state and serves it back - and cross-device sync is free, because a
// person's devices all talk to the same host.
//
// THE THREE PROPERTIES THAT MATTER, in the order they will bite whoever changes this:
//
//   1. The OWNER is derived by the host from the Noise-authenticated connection (see
//      media.js `ownerOf`), never sent by the client. A client cannot write as
//      somebody else because it cannot say who it is.
//   2. There is ONE writer - the host - so there is no cross-writer threat and no
//      conflict resolution to get wrong. The host stamps `updatedAt` itself, so a
//      client cannot backdate a write.
//   3. `playedAt` is separate from `updatedAt`, and that distinction is not
//      decoration - see the resume section.
//
// WHAT THE EXTRACTION PARAMETERISED, and nothing else:
//
//   kinds     the vocabulary a favourite may be OF. Music says track/album/artist;
//             video says movie/episode/series/season. Passed in, not baked.
//   idField   the name of the id field INSIDE a row value. PearTune's rows say
//             `trackId` and its phones read that; a second app has no tracks. The
//             KEYS are unaffected either way - they carry the id, not its name - so
//             an app keeps its stored rows byte-identical by naming its own field.
//
// WHAT DID NOT GET GENERALISED, said plainly rather than left to be discovered: the
// playlist rows and the cross-device session still speak `trackIds`. No second app has
// needed either yet, and renaming a field nothing reads is risk without a payer. Moving
// them here at all was about keeping PearTune's migration on ONE version of this file,
// not a claim that they are already video-shaped.
//
// Rows (Tier 1, library-scoped - see the proposal's tiering):
//   fav:{ownerId}:{kind}:{id}   -> { kind, id, on, updatedAt }
//   resume:{ownerId}:{id}       -> { <idField>, positionMs, durationMs, updatedAt, playedAt, deviceKey }
//   watched:{ownerId}:{id}      -> { <idField>, on, at, auto }
//   count:{ownerId}:{id}        -> { <idField>, count, updatedAt }
//   playlist:{ownerId}:{plId}   -> { id, name, <idField>s:[...], createdAt, updatedAt }
//   session:{ownerId}           -> the cross-device handoff row
//   request:{id}                -> a paired device asking the operator for something
//
// ownerId is `p:{personId}` for a device assigned to a person, else `d:{deviceKey}`
// for an unclaimed device (it is its own owner until the operator confirms a claim).
//
// NOTE: PearTune's milestone-3-phase-1 stored track favourites as
// `fav:{ownerId}:{trackId}` (no kind segment). Those legacy rows do not match a
// `fav:{ownerId}:{kind}:` scan and are simply ignored - a clean break, acceptable
// because favourites only ever held a day of test data. Nothing migrates.
