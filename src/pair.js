// Host side of <app>/pair/1.
//
// DESIGN NOTE (from PearTune, changed 2026-07-13 during milestone 1 - see its DECISIONS).
//
// The first cut copied PearCircle's seeder pairing literally: a Hyperswarm
// rendezvous topic that both the phone and the host joined. That was wrong here,
// and it did not survive contact with the code. Hyperswarm creates its OWN
// HyperDHT server and listens on its keypair, so a host running both a Hyperswarm
// (for pairing) and its own dht.createServer (for media) under one identity had
// two servers fighting over the same keypair. It deadlocked.
//
// The seeder needed a rendezvous because the PHONE held the secrets and the
// seeder was anonymous. Here it is the other way round: the host has a stable
// public key, and that key is already printed in the QR. So the phone just DIALS
// THE HOST BY KEY.
//
// That is strictly stronger than the topic handshake it replaces. Dialing a
// HyperDHT key means Noise authenticates the far end AS that key, so an impostor
// who photographed the QR cannot answer the call at all. "Check the host is who
// the QR claims" stops being a check we must remember to write, and becomes a
// property of the transport.
//
// What `rv` is now: a one-time pairing token, 32 random bytes, presented by the
// phone in its hello to prove it actually saw the QR. The host's public key is an
// ADDRESS, not a secret, so dialing it proves nothing on its own.
