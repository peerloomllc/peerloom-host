//   1. `decide()` - who may OPEN a connection. Wired into HyperDHT's
//      `createServer({ firewall })`, which runs once, at connect time.
//
//   2. `Connections` - who may KEEP one. The firewall hook never runs again for
//      the life of a connection, so revoking a phone that is mid-song would do
//      exactly nothing until it happened to reconnect. The registry tracks every
//      live connection per device so revoke can destroy them immediately.
//
// "Revoke stops the music within a second" is an acceptance test, not a nicety.
